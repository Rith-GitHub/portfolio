                            Currently I'm in my senior year at Dublin High School. I don't have a lot of hobbies, but I enjoy making new things and exercising my creativity. I practice playing the piano when I have free time and I also used to draw. Last year I began learning to cook so that I can be self-sustaining. I've been learning from my mom, but the majority of the recipes she's tried to teach me recently have been beyond my ability. At the very least, I can affirm that I possess basic skills required to meet my basic needs.

                        <p>
                            I find that I delight in creating, and consider that delight to be the reason why I pursue the hobbies that I do.  Especially with composing music and drawing, the act of producing a work from my imagination is something I like doing. Trying to depict what I imagined, combining all the ideas stored in the mind is an amazing way to relax. And like many others, I have songs and music pieces that are my favorite to listen to, styles of art that I find outshine the rest, and cuisine that I love eating. I feel like trying to draw, compose, and cook have enriched these experiences for me. I feel a greater sense of amazement as I am able to comprehend the talent and effort of the creator.

                            For similar reasons I'm also interested in computer science. In middle school I wanted to learn how to code so that I could make video games. I took all sorts of courses and searched for any resources I could make use of. In my freshman year of high school I took Computer Science Principles. It was that class that changed the way I saw computer science. It was also through that class that I learned of my school's Engineering Academy, and became a member in 2017 (<a href="https://www.dublin.k12.ca.us/Page/4782" target="_blank">Here is the website of the academy</a> ). In my sophomore year I took Principles of Engineering, which opened my mind up to other fields of engineering. When I became a junior I took AP Computer Science Applications to further expand my knowledge. This year, I am taking Digital Electronics to expand my scope to computer hardware and see whether the field is worth exploring further.

                            In AP CSA during my junior year a college graduate came to our class to talk about artificial intelligence. They presented their work and explained how neural networks work. I was amazed by their work and inspired to pursue further into artificial intelligence. Since then Iâ€™ve been trying to create my own neural network and exploring the fields artificial intelligence applies to. It is my hope to find employment in this field and to perhaps be on the forefront of the development of AI.
