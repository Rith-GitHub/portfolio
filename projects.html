                                For this project I connected a seven segment display to a programmable logic device. The PLD would output signals to the SSD so that a message could be displayed. I programmed the PLD so that the circuit would display the message, "Secret to everyone". Logic expressions were created so that each segment would light up at the correct states, forming the characters used in the phrase. Using a PLD is much faster than creating the circuit using integrated circuits with AOI Logic. Moreover, it is quick and easy to edit the logic of the PLD because it does not require rewiring physical components.

                                We created a model of the logic expression a printer would use to warn its user when it needs maintenance (eg. refill ink). For this we decided a warning would be raised if there is no paper in the printer, no black ink, or (if the printer is set to print in color) no cyan, magenta, or yellow ink. With this in mind we created a truth table outlining the resulting output of every combination of inputs. From this table I created an unsimplified logic expression using the maxterms, then simplified the expression. The purpose of doing so is to reduce the amount of AOI logic components required to make the printer's warning system. Using a CDS I modeled the circuit to guarantee that it functions the way we intended. Once we confirmed the logic expression was correct, the circuit was created on a breadboard to demonstrate concretely how our design works.

                                As a 3-person team, we created an Android app to provide recipe recommendations based on the quantity of ingredients available to the user.
                                I designed the structure of the ingredient and recipe databases for efficient access by the program, and wrote the functionality for inputting ingredients and recommending recipes.

                                The objective of this project was to create a chatbot that could respond to human inputs in an effort to imitate a human conversation.
                                I created a chatbot that was meant to give information requested by the user about a certain subject.
                                Designed to be easily usable, it would take human input in the form of phrases and questions.
                                These phrases would be filtered for certain key words to determine the most fitting response.
                                In addition to refining the process of generating responses, this project could be expanded by adding the ability to use speech and audio recordings as the input into the program.

                                    I created a game of solitaire. There was the table, where the cards were laid out in rows, the deck that the cards were drawn from, and the piles to sort the cards into.
                                    Classes were needed for each part of the game, and functionality was needed to allow the ui to move cards between subsections.

                                    In this project our team's goal was to create the software for a residential elevator servicing three floors, as well as to make a design for the elevator and model it using VEX parts and its programming language RobotC.
                                    Our elevator design moves the cab using sprockets and chains (the cab is attatched to the chain), and has touch sensors at each floor that allows the system to know which floor the cab is at and when it arrives at a floor.
                                    Additionally, there was a button on each floor to call the cab to their respective floor.
                                    The software was designed so that whenever a request for the cab to move to a different floor was made via the buttons, the program would detect which floor the cab is on to determine which direction the cab should move, and once moving, it will continue until the sensor on the requested floor detects the cab.
                                    If five seconds pass without any floors being called the cab moves down to the first floor.
                                    Because my goal was the software behind our elevator my main contribution was the creation of the program as well as its troubleshooting.

                                    The objective of this project was to create a winch that could lift a weight of 100 grams up 30 cm using an electrical motor.
                                    For this project our team was given a power supply, motor, and a variety of parts that could be utilized in the creation of our prototypes.
                                    With the set amount of electrical power provided for the electrical system, it is the goal of this project to maximize the efficiency of the model.
                                    My contributions to this project was in the brainstorming of concepts that to maximize the mechanical power of our model, as well as in the creation, modification, and prototyping of our developing models.

                                The objective of this project was to use the coding language python to make a project that emulated the original game hangman. The game was to use a preset list of strings, and let the user guess the letters in the word the function randomly picked. The players ability to guess had to account as many different keyboard inputs as possible, such as punctuation, different casings (ex. A versus a), and inputting multiple characters at once, which the code was able to account for with different functions that we had learned to use. We had decided, and implemented, our code would treat letters of different casing the same, would ignore punctuation, and treat simultaneous inputs the same as several individual inputs.

                                    The objective of this project was to practice different type of variables. The development of this project to meet the requirements consisted of two parts; Making the game functional and implement the variable types, and making the game simple. With my partner we traded these tasks every once in a while, where one of us added new features while the other simplified the code of existing features. In class we shared the work we had done and coordinated what work should be done next. Simplification and bug fixing were the most prominent challenges in developing the game because when we made separate modifications, the scipts sometimes contradicted each other. This was better avoided when we shared the changes we made in more detail and added comments within the script, so we knew what was already being done and which code would become repetitive.
