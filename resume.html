                            Throughout the year various opportunities to expand my understanding of the engineering field were provided to me. It was through these opportunities that I was able to visualize more clearly what I should expect and prepare for in the future.

                        <p>
                            One of these opportunities was when Dan Cherrier and Natalina Bernardi gave a presentation about getting a Professional Engineering Liscense and what the path to obtaining one looks like for a civil engineer. Although I am not pursuing the field in which they targeted their advice, what they said was still relevant. Their directions on what steps should be taken helped determine what path I should take in order to be successful. The criteria they recommended to determine what college to go to has been especially beneficial in the recent past.

                            Another presentation that was impactful to me was when Jason Yosinski, a researcher in machine learning at Uber AI Labs, visited to talk about his work. He presented projects in which his study, neural networks, could be applied and explained how neural networks create the algorithm to execute tasks. In his demonstration he showed a robot that uses machine learning to teach itself how to move. Since then Iâ€™ve been trying to create my own neural network and exploring the applications of machine learning. It is because of this presentation that I am inspired to study in this field and strive to one day be on the forefront of the development of machine learning.

                            On a field trip to Cisco Systems we were shown what type of activities were done as workers of the company. I learned about the type of products they make and the design process that they go through to make sure they give their best work. Since Cisco Systems specializes in software and networking equipment they also have to make sure whatever they make is secure and does not put their client at risk. We also got to see the different utilities they had in their workplaces so they could improve productivity from their workers.

                            Another field trip I went on was to Roche Molecular to be a part of their "STEM Careers in Healthcare Day". I participated in various workshops about the equipment scientists at Roche use, how they decide what projects are most beneficial to take on as a company, and what businesses do to attract the attention of the public. Most impactful to me was the career mentoring we recieved afterwards. Being a company that focuses more on biotech and medicine, I didn't expect for anything to be especially relevant to my study of interest, computer science; However, I was taught that there is a need for data scientists to compile the information that is obtained from Roche's diagnostics technology. I was reminded that there are many professions in which computer science is applicable that are outside of one's expectations.

                            Taking a part in the Engineering Academy's mentorship program has been a vital to preparing me for the future. There exists a plethora of skills required to function, and especially communicate, in a professional work environment. With the mock interview and practice networking events, I was able to put those skills to use. I now know what I need to do to improve, and will be able to start strong as I find employement.
