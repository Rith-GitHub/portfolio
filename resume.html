                            Throughout the year various opportunities to expand my understanding of the engineering field were provided to me. It was through these opportunities that I was able to visualize more clearly what I should expect and prepare for in the future.

                            A presentation from guest speakers that came to our class to talk about engineering licensing stood out to me because of what they talked about in regards to the type of work that is done depending on your hierarchy in the workplace. Generally, as you rise to managment positions, the amount of work spent doing engineering tasks becomes less and the amount of time spent organizing people and managing products increases. They emphasized that as an engineer one had to be able to work with people and have the intention to have a positive effect on others. Knowing what to expect as an engineer helps narrow what future I want for myself.

                            Another presentation that was impactful to me was when a researcher in machine learning came to our class to talk about their work. They presented projects in which their study, neural networks, could be applied and explained how neural networks create the algorithm to execute tasks. I was amazed by their work and inspired to learn more about artificial intelligence. Since then Iâ€™ve been trying to create my own neural network and exploring the applications of machine learning. It is because of this presentation that I am inspired to study in this field and strive to one day be on the forefront of the development of machine learning.

                            On a field trip to Cisco Systems we were shown what type of activities were done as workers of the company. I learned about the type of products they make and the design process that they go through to make sure they give their best work. Since Cisco Systems specializes in software and networking equipment they also have to make sure whatever they make is secure and does not put their client at risk. We also got to see the different utilities they had in their workplaces so they could improve productivity from their workers.

                            Taking a part in the Engineering Academy's mentorship program has been a vital to preparing me for the future. There exists a plethora of skills required to function, and especially communicate, in a professional work environment. With the mock interview and practice networking events, I was able to put those skills to use. I now know what I need to do to improve, and will be able to start strong as I find employement.
